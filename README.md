# Find Your Hat Game

Welcome to the "Find Your Hat" game! This project is a simple text-based game where you navigate through a field to find your hat while avoiding holes. The game is played using the command line interface.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using the command: `node main.js`
2. You'll be presented with a grid representing the field. You start at the top-left corner (*) and your goal is to find the hat (^).
3. Input directions (w, a, s, d) to move the player character (*).
4. Avoid falling into holes (O) and make sure you stay within the field boundaries.
5. The game ends when you find your hat, fall into a hole, or move outside the field.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the `main.js` file. You can adjust the field dimensions and hole percentage by changing the parameters passed to the `Field.generateField()` method.

## Example Field

Here's an example of how a field might look:
