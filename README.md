# Find Your Hat Game

A simple terminal-based game where you have to navigate through a field filled with holes and obstacles to find your hat.

## Overview

In this game, you'll start at the upper-left corner of a field and your goal is to find your hat (^) while avoiding holes (O) and staying within the boundaries of the field.

### Game Rules

1. Use the following commands to move:
   - `w` to move up
   - `s` to move down
   - `a` to move left
   - `d` to move right

2. As you move, the `*` symbol represents your current position on the field.

3. The game ends in the following scenarios:
   - You find your hat (^): Congratulations, you win!
   - You fall into a hole (O): Oops, you lose!
   - You move outside the field boundaries: Oops, you lose!

## Getting Started

## Additional Features
Feel free to customize and extend the game! Here are a few ideas:
